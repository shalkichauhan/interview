//Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters
//pseudo code
// function that accepts a string.
// iterate over the string. run 2 loops (outer and inner)
//prepare an object, assign each item as key in that object if it doesn't exist already
// increment the inner loop and then check, if the item is not present in that object, then add that item as key again and proceed.
//
// if the item already exists then break out of loop and start again from the outer loop
// update the max number to the pointer of the inner loop.
// use math.Max to keep the max of the value in max
